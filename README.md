============================

                   Simple MicroRTOS for PIC 18F Family using Satck Manipulation

                                     About This Project
Implementation of Simple RTOS - Real Time Operating System - for PIC 18F Family using Satck Manipulation.
With the new PIC18 core, users now have access to the stack and can modify the stack pointer and stack
data directly .
Until now this Simple RTOS manages system resources and schedules execution of various tasks
and also provides inter-task communication through flags -common variables- only.
